- Target ID: 03_API
- Objective: Validate API contract area integrity and page map alignment.

Execution Rules:

- Use shell read commands as needed to inspect markdown and agent files.
- When evidence exists, provide precise file paths and optional line numbers.
- If no issue is found, return an empty findings array and status pass.

Severity Policy:
- critical: missing mandatory references or hard SSOT violations
