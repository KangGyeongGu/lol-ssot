| Task | Target | Agent | Status | Max Severity | Findings | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| AGENTSPEC-BACKEND | BACKEND_AGENT_SKILL | agent-spec-auditor | FAIL | high | 2 | Backend agent/skill wiring is mostly consistent, but one high-severity mandatory reference path issue and one medium traceability reference issue were found within the scoped specs. |
| AGENTSPEC-FRONTEND | FRONTEND_AGENT_SKILL | agent-spec-auditor | PASS | low | 0 | Validated FRONTEND and COMMON agent/skill wiring within scope; role coverage, domain mappings, required references, and master-subskill bindings are consistent with SSOT expectations and no violations were found. |
