REL-API-BACKEND,API_BACKEND,relation-auditor,pass,low,0,"Backend API/realtime implementation-rule documents consistently reference `03_API` as contract SSOT, and no API↔backend rule conflicts or relation-level duplication were found within the scoped paths."
REL-API-FRONTEND,API_FRONTEND,relation-auditor,fail,high,2,Frontend routing SSOT drifts from API contract SSOT on PageRoute usage: FE rules currently include non-contract route values as PageRoute and overgeneralize pageRoute-driven transitions.
REL-DESIGN-FRONTEND,DESIGN_FRONTEND,relation-auditor,warn,medium,2,"Frontend documents correctly reference design token and page-requirement sources, but two medium relation-drift issues remain around ownership and scope clarity between design requirements and frontend consumption rules."
REL-DOMAIN-API,DOMAIN_API,relation-auditor,warn,medium,2,Found 2 medium DOMAIN_API consistency issues: one-way cross-area references (DOMAIN->API only) and a stage mapping drift in ROOM_GAME_STARTED.
REL-DOMAIN-BACKEND,DOMAIN_BACKEND,relation-auditor,fail,high,1,Found a high-severity domain-to-backend mapping mismatch: backend write-back timing rule does not preserve the domain SSOT’s per-entity timing requirements.
REL-PRODUCT-API,PRODUCT_API,relation-auditor,fail,high,2,Found 2 PRODUCT_API relation issues: 1 high mapping conflict in lifecycle REST routing and 1 medium requirement-to-contract traceability gap.
REL-PRODUCT-DESIGN,PRODUCT_DESIGN,relation-auditor,fail,critical,3,"Detected PRODUCT_DESIGN SSOT relation failures: direct cross-area references are missing, intent-to-design mapping is implicit, and behavioral rules are duplicated across Product and Design without explicit ownership links."
